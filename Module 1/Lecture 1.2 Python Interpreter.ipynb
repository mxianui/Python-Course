Conversely, Java, C, and C++ belong to the group of *compiled languages*. In these languages, a compiler converts the statements in source files into binary machine code, which are afterwards executed by the computer hardware.

Consequently, running Python programs is slower than running C or C++ programs, because the code is interpreted as it is executed. On the other hand, writing and testing Python programs is faster and easier than writing and testing programs with the compiled languages.
